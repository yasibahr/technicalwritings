# A Repository for my Compiled Technical Writings and Guides
Throughout all my years as a student, I researched and compiled a variety of information into different guides and notes, which my classmates and I have used to study for exams. I am currenlty in the process of compiling these notes into this GitHub repository. 

This repository includes information on Git, coding (Java, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript), database, and others.

Please note that a few of my guides are unavailable, as they were written during my time at the RCMP, and are therefore not open to the public.
